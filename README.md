  - Used by the UI. 
  - Once changes are tested on the staging subgraph, they are pushed to the canonical subgraph. 
- [Staging Subgraph](https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/cujowolf/beanstalk-dev)
  - Used for testing fixes or improvements to the development subgraph. 
- [Development Subgraph](https://graph.playgrounds.academy/subgraphs/name/beanstalk)
